"Allow not sleep to close your wearied eyes,  
Until you have reckoned up each daytime deed:  
‘Where did I go wrong? What did I do? And what duty’s left undone?’  
From first to last review your acts and then  
Reprove yourself for wretched [or cowardly] acts, but rejoice in those done well."  

- Epictetus, [Discourses](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0236%3Atext%3Ddisc%3Abook%3D3%3Achapter%3D10)
